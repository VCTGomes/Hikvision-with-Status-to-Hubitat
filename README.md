This app and driver have the ability to import the locker, available on certain Hikvision intercoms, to Hubitat. The Lock button won't, since doorbell is only capable of emitting a pulse to unlock.

This app is also capable of synchronizing the closed/open status based on a contact sensor. If you're not interested in having the status, it's possible to install [the light version](https://github.com/VCTGomes/Hikvision-Door-Control-to-Hubitat) that only unlocks the door.

This application and driver are based on the work of [matthewpetro](https://github.com/matthewpetro/hubitat-projects/tree/main/garage-door), who maintain the garage-door-app, which I modified to meet the needs of Hikvision and import the door status.

This is an initial version that I made for my own use and may improve in the future.
